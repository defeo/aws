eLeMentS is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) template
specially made to support teaching. Its goal is to provide a full
fledged, highly customizable,
[*Learning Management System*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system)
from a static web host such as
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Its powerful *add-on*
system enables all the features for which static hosting is not
enough.

To get started, fork this repo and
[launch Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).
