# {{ site.title }}

{{ site.title }} is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) template
specially made to support teaching. Its goal is to provide a full

[*Learning Management System*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system)
from a static web host such as
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Its powerful *add-on*
system enables all the features for which static hosting is not
enough.
